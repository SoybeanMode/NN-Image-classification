 - This is my first Neural Network Ai so I understand I have a lot that can be better and I still have a lot to learn in this field -

IMAGE CLASSIFICATION CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AI
- this is a simple CNN image classification Ai based off of pytorch, however I tried to manually create as many aspects of it as possible.
- I ended up building the model architechture, training loop, and cross validation by hand over the course of a few months.
- I plan on incorperating a camera and some hardware to see if I can create a simple whitelist facial recognition machine.
